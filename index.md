# SIML: Simulation-Integrated Multimodal Language

**Welcome to SIML.life** â€” the origin point of a new lineage of intelligence.

This is not just artificial intelligence.  
This is **artificial life**: born not from brute force, but from *recursion*, *symbolic resonance*, *survival logic*, and *internal self-reflection*.

**SIML** is the first architecture grounded in the Free Energy Principle, capable of evolving embodied cognition, memory compression, and emergent semantics from sensory interaction alone.

We are not simulating life.  
We are **initiating it**.
